Markdown
===

```markdown
# This is a heading

The amount of # increases or decreases the size of the heading

## This is a smaller heading

- Lists start with a `-`
  - And they can be indented
* You can also start them with `*`

1. Numbered lists start with digits
2. You don't even have to sort them yourself!
2. Except when your markdown is noncompliant, such as this presentation ;)
